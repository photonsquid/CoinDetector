# Recoinize

## Motivation

The field of computer vision has made significant progress in recent years, enabling machines to recognize and understand visual content to a greater extent than ever before. One particular area of interest is object recognition, which involves identifying and categorizing objects in digital images. However, even with state-of-the-art algorithms and techniques, coin recognition remains a challenging problem due to the complexity and variability of the coins.

Recognizing coins has practical applications in various domains, from vending machines to banking and finance. Accurately identifying and classifying coins can streamline processes, reduce errors, and increase efficiency in various industries. Furthermore, developing an efficient and reliable system for coin recognition can significantly benefit individuals who are visually impaired, allowing them to more easily distinguish between different coins.

In this project, we propose an AI-based approach to recognize euro coins. Specifically, we will train a neural network using a siamese or triplet architecture to find the optimal parameters to associate each image with a highly discriminative output vector. We will then use this network to classify and identify the coins in our dataset. Our approach is designed to provide accurate and efficient results while overcoming the inherent complexity and variability of coin recognition.

Overall, our work has the potential to make significant contributions to the field of computer vision and practical applications in various industries. By developing an efficient and reliable system for coin recognition, we can improve accuracy, streamline processes, and increase accessibility for individuals who are visually impaired.
